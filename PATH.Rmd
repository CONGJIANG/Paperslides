# Introduction
Overlap weights have four statistical advantages: 1) Minimum variance of the nonparametric estimator among all balancing weights; 
--
2) Exact balance for means of included covariates in logistic propensity score model;
--
 3) Weights are bounded (unlike IPW);
--
 4) Avoids ad hoc eliminating cases: continuously down-weigh units in the tail.

--

"absolute value" weights from Wallace and Moodie 2015 are identical to overlap weights. 

--

However, in my knowledge, overlap weights with interference receive little attention in the literature.

### Propensity score weighted-estimators with interference 
Based on the interference inference framework of Liu et al. 2016, also in the light of overlap weights (Li et al. 2018), we first have some definition of causal effects in the presence of interference, then investigate propensity weights with interference, especially overlap weights with interference.

## Concepts (Liu et al. 2016)

$\pi\left(a_{i} ; \phi\right)=\phi^{a_{i}}(1-\phi)^{1-a_{i}}$: the probability of individual $i$ receiving treatment $a_i$. 
--
$\pi\left(s_{i} ; \phi\right)=\phi^{\Sigma s_{i}}(1-\phi)^{\left|s_{i}\right|-\Sigma s_{i}}$: the probability of the interference set for individual $i$ receiving treatment $s_i$ under allocation strategy $\phi$.

--

$\pi\left(a_{i}, s_{i} ; \phi\right)=\pi\left(a_{i} ; \phi\right) \pi\left(s_{i} ; \phi\right)$: the probability of individual $i$ together with their interference set receiving joint treatment $(a_i, s_i)$ under allocation strategy $\phi$.

$\bar{y}_{i}(a, \phi)=\sum_{s_{i}} y_{i}\left(a_{i}=a, s_{i}\right) \pi\left(s_{i} ; \phi\right)$: the average potential outcome of individual $i$ under allocation strategy $\phi$, where the summation is over all $2^{|S_i|}$ possible values of $s_i$.

--

$\bar{y}(a, \phi)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \bar{y}_{i}(a, \phi) / n$ : the population average potential outcome. 

$\bar{y}_{i}(\phi)=\sum_{a_{i}, s_{i}} y_{i}\left(a_{i}, s_{i}\right) \pi_{i}\left(a_{i}, s_{i} ; \phi\right)$: the marginal average potential outcome for individual $i$ under allocation strategy $\phi$,

--
and $\bar{y}(\phi)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \bar{y}_{i}(\phi) / n$ is defined as the population marginal average potential outcome.

### Causal Effects: contrasts in the population average potential outcomes. 

--
The direct effect of treatment under allocation strategy $\phi$: $\overline{\mathrm{DE}}(\phi)=g\{\bar{y}(1, \phi), \bar{y}(0, \phi)\}$, where $g(x_1, x_2)$ is some continuous contrast function, such as $g\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=x_{1}-x_{2}$, $g\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=1 - x_{1}/x_{2}$

--

$\textit{The direct effect}$ compares the average potential outcomes when an individual receives treatment versus not under allocation strategy $\phi$. 

--

For two allocation strategies $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, the $\textit{indirect or spillover effect}$, which contrasts average potential outcomes when individuals do not receive treatment under different allocation strategies, is defined as $\overline{\mathrm{IE}}\left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right)=g\left\{\bar{y}\left(0, \phi_{1}\right), \bar{y}\left(0, \phi_{2}\right)\right\}$. Could also be defined for when individuals receive treatment, $a = 1$.

# Causal Effects

The $\textit{total effect}$, $\overline{\mathrm{TE}}\left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right)=g\left\{\bar{y}\left(1, \phi_{1}\right), \bar{y}\left(0, \phi_{2}\right)\right\}$,  incorporates both direct and indirect effects, and reflects the difference between the average potential outcomes when individuals receive treatment under one allocation strategy versus when they go without treatment under another allocation strategy. 

--

$\textit{Overall effect}$, $\overline{\mathrm{OE}}\left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right)=g\left\{\bar{y}\left(\phi_{1}\right), \bar{y}\left(\phi_{2}\right)\right\}$, describes the contrast in average outcomes under one allocation strategy relative to another.

# ESTIMATORS
--

Estimators of the population average outcome for treatment $a$ and allocation
strategy $\phi$ are
$$\hat{Y}^{w}(a, \phi) = \frac{\sum_{i} w_{A_i, S_i}(x_i, \mathbb{x_i}) y_{i}(A_{i}, S_{i}) 1(A_{i}=a)} {\sum_{i} w_{A_i, S_i}(x_i, \mathbb{x_i})1 (A_{i}=a) }$$
???
IWP estimators of the population average outcome for treatment $a$ and allocation strategy $\phi$ is $w_{A_i, S_i}(x_i, \mathbb{x_i}) = 1/f\left(A_{i}, S_{i} \mid x_i, \mathbb{x_i}\right)$
--

Hájek-type IPW estimators of the population average outcome for treatment $a$ and allocation strategy $\phi$ is $w_{A_i, S_i}(x_i, \mathbb{x_i}) = \pi\left(S_{i} ; \phi\right)/f\left(A_{i}, S_{i} \mid x_i, \mathbb{x_i}\right)$


--
Generally, we have 
$$w_{A_i, S_i}(x_i, \mathbb{x_i}) = h_{S_i}(x_i, \mathbb{x_i}) /f\left(A_{i}, S_{i} \mid x_i, \mathbb{x_i}\right)$$

Want to show: consistency of weighted estimators

--

If $f\left(A_{i}, S_{i} \mid x_i, \mathbb{x_i}\right)$ is known for all $i$, then $\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y}^{w}(a, \phi)] =  \bar{y}(a,\phi)$ and $\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y}^{w}(\phi)] = \bar{y}(\phi)$
