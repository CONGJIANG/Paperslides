For a probabilistic model problem, the frequentist solve the optimization questions, while the Bayesian solve the integral questions. 

--

Bayesian Inference refers to solve the posterior distribution of the parameters $$p(\theta | X) = \frac{p(X|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(x)}$$
--

#### Bayesian Decision
From the Bayesian point of view,  for a new data $\hat{x}$, we need to solve: 
--

$$p(\hat{x}|X) =\int_\theta p(\hat{x},\theta|X)d\theta=\int_\theta p(\theta|X)p(\hat{x}|\theta,X)d\theta$$

--

If this new data is independent dataset $X$, then the Bayesian Decision is the expectation of the distribution with respect to the posterior distribution. 
--


The key point of Bayesian Inference is solving the posterior distribution of the parameters and can be divided as (1) Accurate Inference. (2) Approximation Inference. 

Approximation Inference includes certain approximation (VI) and random approximation (MCMC, MH, Gibbs).
